+ change tooltip text to black
+ titles are getting chopped off at the left side. fix this.
+ The mockups suggested positioning titles on the right or left depending. Having the shortened title as is (...) is an ok alternative, as long as I can fix the bug where the left side is getting chopped.
+ as screen size gets smaller, the width should change. until it gets too small, then we can just get rid of it.
+ work on minimized view. be able to transition between minimized view and normal view.
